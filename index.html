        <p>Hi, my name is Rose X. and I am pursuing a CS degree. I am currently attending a community college, but I hope to transfer to NC State when the time comes.</p>
        <p>I am very new to programming and just recently started a college course in Java. I am participating in CTD in hopes of learning a bit more about web development since I am still indecisive about whether to do front-end or back-end. Maybe even both. Cybersecurity and digital forensics has peaked my interst, but so has web development since one of my hobbies is visual arts.</p>
